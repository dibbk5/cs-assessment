4. As the size of the number getting passed in gets larger the the time of both gets longer. However, the doublerAppend funciton
    scales better since there are fewer steps in the .push method then there are in the .unshift method. We can tell that .push
    scales better because as the size of the number being passed in gets larger the speed does not change as much as the .unshift method.

5.  The unshift method inserts the value into the beginning of the array. It does this by shifting the items in the array up in index then
    inserting the value into index 0.
